      <h2>3. Size Determination Process</h2>
      <p>
        Accurate sizing is crucial for a successful resize. You'll need to
        provide us with your correct ring size through one of these methods:
      </p>
      <p>
        • If you have a ring that fits perfectly, our team can help you
        determine the size
        <br />
        • Visit a local jewelry store for professional sizing
        <br />• Use our online size guide for self-measurement instructions
      </p>

      <h2>4. Return Shipping</h2>
      <p>
        Once we confirm your accurate ring size, you'll need to ship the ring
        back to us in its original packaging. If you're unable to arrange
        shipping yourself, we can assist with a reverse pickup service.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Resizing Coverage</h2>
      <p>
        Our free resizing service covers the resizing process and return
        shipping back to you. The entire process typically takes 7-10 business
        days once we receive your ring.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Size Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        Free resizing is available for adjustments up to{" "}
        <strong>3 US sizes up or down</strong>
        from your original size. Changes beyond this range will incur an
        additional fee for resizing due to the complexity of the work required.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Restrictions</h2>
      <p>
        • <strong>Eternity Bands:</strong> Free resizing is not available for
        full eternity bands due to their continuous stone setting. Please
        contact us before purchase if you're unsure about sizing. Eternity band
        resizing is available.
        <br />• <strong>One-Time Service:</strong> Free resizing is available
        only once per ring. Subsequent resizing requests will incur additional
        charges based on the complexity.
        <br />• <strong>Custom/Engraved Pieces:</strong> Some customized or
        engraved items may have resizing limitations.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Pickup Instructions</h2>
      <p>If you choose our reverse pickup service, please note that:</p>
      <p>
        • OTP verification will be required using your registered phone number
        <br />
        • You must be available during the scheduled pickup time
        <br />
        • Only 2 pickup attempts will be made
        <br />• If unsuccessful after 2 attempts, you'll need to arrange your
        own shipping
      </p>
