      <p>
        <strong>15% of original purchase value</strong> will be credited to your

      <h2>4. Program Limitations</h2>
      <p>

        advantage of this program within the specified timeframe.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Return Process</h2>
      <p>
        Once your buy-back request is approved, you'll need to ship the jewelry

        Lining Credit (store credit) to your account after this quality check
        process is completed.
